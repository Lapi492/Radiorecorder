This program records KBS 1FM for 2 hours.

It needs Chromedriver, ffmpeg, and Selenium(Python package) to run.
Also, you have to enable Google Drive API and have your credentials to use auto-upload to Google Drive.

If you are using macOS, use caffeinate to prevent stop recording from system sleeping.
(For example: `caffeinate -i python3 record_kbs_1fm.py`)
